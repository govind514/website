<h1>Say Goodbye to 'Tech Neck': 5 Tips for a Healthier Neck</h1>

<p>In today’s digital world, hours spent on smartphones, tablets, and laptops can lead to “tech neck” — neck pain, stiffness, and headaches caused by prolonged forward-head posture. <strong>At Mehar Physiotherapy Clinic,</strong> we help patients prevent and manage this modern-day issue with practical, easy-to-follow strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Here are five key tips:</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Be Mindful of Your Posture</strong> – Keep devices at eye level and adjust your screen height to reduce strain.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Take Frequent Breaks</strong> – Short movement breaks every 20–30 minutes can keep neck muscles relaxed.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Gentle Neck Stretches</strong> – Light daily stretches can improve flexibility and ease discomfort.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Strengthen Your Upper Back</strong> – Building shoulder and upper back strength supports better posture.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Create an Ergonomic Workspace</strong> – Use supportive seating and arrange your desk to promote healthy alignment.</p>

<p>If neck pain persists, don’t ignore it. Our team can provide a thorough assessment and a personalized treatment plan to keep your neck healthy and pain-free.</p>
