<h1>Staying Active and Independent: How Physiotherapy Helps Seniors</h1>

<p>Staying active is essential for older adults to maintain strength, balance, and overall quality of life. <strong>At Mehar Physiotherapy Clinic,</strong> we focus on helping seniors move confidently, reduce pain, and prevent injuries.</p>

<p><strong>Key benefits of physiotherapy for seniors include:</strong></p>
<p>- Improved balance to reduce fall risk.</p>
<p>- Pain management strategies for arthritis and other chronic conditions.</p>
<p>- Safe recovery after surgeries like knee or hip replacements.</p>
<p>- Strength and endurance training to support everyday activities.</p>
<p>- Maintaining independence through improved mobility and self-confidence.</p>

<p>With the right care, aging doesn’t have to mean slowing down. Our physiotherapists can create programs that keep you active and enjoying life.</p>
