<h1>5 Common Physiotherapy Myths Debunked</h1>

<p>Many people have misconceptions about physiotherapy, which can prevent them from seeking the care they need. At Mehar Physiotherapy Clinic, we believe in empowering our patients with knowledge. Here are five common myths about physiotherapy, debunked:</p>

<p><strong>Myth 1:</strong> Physiotherapy is only for injuries and accidents.<br>
<strong>Fact:</strong> While physiotherapy is crucial for recovering from injuries, it's also a proactive way to improve your overall health. It can help with posture correction, managing chronic conditions like arthritis, and improving athletic performance.</p>

<p><strong>Myth 2:</strong> I need a doctor's referral to see a physiotherapist.<br>
<strong>Fact:</strong> In India, you do not need a doctor's referral to see a qualified physiotherapist. You can directly book an appointment for assessment and treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Myth 3:</strong> Physiotherapy is painful.<br>
<strong>Fact:</strong> The goal is to relieve pain, not cause it. While some exercises may cause mild discomfort, your physiotherapist ensures you’re comfortable throughout treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Myth 4:</strong> Physiotherapy is just a series of exercises.<br>
<strong>Fact:</strong> Exercise is important, but physiotherapy also includes manual therapy, education, and lifestyle advice.</p>

<p><strong>Myth 5:</strong> I can just find exercises online and do them myself.<br>
<strong>Fact:</strong> A one-size-fits-all approach can be harmful. A physiotherapist tailors your plan to your specific needs.</p>
