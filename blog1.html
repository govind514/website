<div class="mybox"><strong>Myth 2:</strong> I need a doctor's referral to see a physiotherapist.<br>
<strong>Fact:</strong> In India, you do not need a doctor's referral to see a qualified physiotherapist...</div>

<div class="mybox"><strong>Myth 3:</strong> Physiotherapy is painful.<br>
<strong>Fact:</strong> The goal of physiotherapy is to relieve pain, not cause it...</div>

<div class="mybox"><strong>Myth 4:</strong> Physiotherapy is just a series of exercises.<br>
<strong>Fact:</strong> Exercise is a key component, but physiotherapy may also include manual therapy, education, and lifestyle advice.</div>
